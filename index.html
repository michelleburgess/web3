The new threshold applies to the amounts spent to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property that would normally qualify as a capital item. As a result of this change, small businesses – those that do not maintain audited financial statements – will be able to immediately deduct many of those expenditures that previously required depreciation.</p></div><div class="w3-third"><iron-icon icon="icons:pan-tool"></iron-icon><h3>Put your kids to work in your Business</h3><p>One way to reduce your tax</p></div><div class="w3-third"><iron-icon icon="icons:event"></iron-icon><h3>Computerized Accounting</h3><p>We offer a full range of computerized accounting and bookkeeping solutions</p></div></div></paper-material></section><section data-route="contact"><paper-material elevation="1"><h2 class="page-title">See Beyond The Numbers</h2><p>Michele Moreland</p><p class="paper-font-subhead">Tax Coach (Consultant)</p><p>Accountant (CPA current in state of Florida) with experience in both the private and public sectors.
